# üìò DataCamp Code Alongs

It all started with a simple thought: *Am I really getting the most out of my DataCamp subscription?*  
I had gone through courses, aced a few skill assessments, and wrapped up some projects. Yet, something felt incomplete.  

That‚Äôs when I stumbled upon **Code-Alongs**. At first, I wasn‚Äôt sure if they were worth the effort. But curiosity won. I rolled up my sleeves, decided to give them a shot‚Äîand this repository was born.  

This repo is my **living journal** of those experiments, failures, learnings, and small victories. Each folder here represents a different code-along that I worked through, recreated, and sometimes even expanded on.

## üíª Why Local Instead of DataLab?

DataCamp offers its own environment, but I found it restrictive. My machine, with proper tools and GPU acceleration, gives me more freedom. That‚Äôs why every code-along here comes with its own:
- `requirements.txt` ‚Üí for reproducible environments  
- A Jupyter Notebook or Python script ‚Üí for the actual implementation  

So if anyone wants to follow along, they can set it up easily on their own system.

## üîÆ What‚Äôs Next?

This is just the beginning. I‚Äôll keep adding:
- More code-alongs  
- Extra notes where I tweak or extend the exercises  
- Best practices I discover along the way  

Think of this repo as a **growing story**, where every chapter is a new code-along completed.
